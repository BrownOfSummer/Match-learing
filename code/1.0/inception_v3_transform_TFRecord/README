A test of transform model
Using the Inception-v3 model as a feature extractor, then use a full connect layer to classify the features;
Inception model: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_dec_2015.zip
while google example use http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz
the pb file has same md5 value, and contains a mobile net in it for switching.

Instead of using image_list dict, 
(1) ./convert_img_to_feature_record.py
    firstly calucate the image's feature vector and then covert the feature vectors to tfrecord, 
    with text and image name; Need to load Inceptionv3 model !
(2) ./train.py 
    secondly, define a fully connected layer, read the tfrecord file in batch, train, valid and save the model.
    Do not need to load Inceptionv3 model
(3) ./config.py constants and pathes;
    ./utils.py functions to decode TFRecord and train the models.
