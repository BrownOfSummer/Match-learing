A test of transform model
Using the Inception-v3 model as a feature extractor, then use a full connect layer to classify the features;
Inception model: https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_dec_2015.zip

Instead of using image_list dict, 
(1) firstly calucate the image's feature vector and then covert the feature vectors to tfrecord, with text and image name;
    Need to load Inceptionv3 model !
(2) secondly, read the tfrecord file in batch;
(3) define a fully connect layer to train the model; Do not need to load Inceptionv3 model
