Files annotation:
    (1) ./convert_img_to_record.py: convert images to TFRecord, with label, shape, and human readable text together;
        For proper use the batch read, the image size should be consistent, a tool with opencv is provided;
    (2) ./convert_record_to_single.py: simply covert the record one-by-one, use tf.decoder or numpy decoder are both provided;
    (3) ./convert_record_to_single_queue.py: do same thing as (2), but use a tensorflow queue for testing
    (4) ./convert_record_to_batch.py: read batches from TFRecord file for num_epochs times, and show each batch contents for verifing that it is correct;
        both shuffle and unshuffle pattern are provided, which is useful for training and valiation
